# Specs completeness gate (see the sowel-feature skill).
#
# A NEW spec folder marks a new feature, and a feature's folder must carry the
# three documents the workflow produces:
#   spec.md · architecture.md · plan.md
#
# This check fails a PR only when it CREATES a new specs/<NNN-name>/ folder that
# is missing one of the three. It deliberately ignores PRs that merely add files
# to an existing spec folder (issue fixes, follow-up notes, review screenshots),
# and never retro-fails the historical specs that predate this rule.
#
# Runs in CI (pull_request) and locally: `bash scripts/check-specs-complete.sh`.
# Portable to bash 3.2 (macOS) — no mapfile / associative arrays.
