# Specs index gate.
#
# `docs/specs-index.md` is meant to be "every feature ever shipped in this
# repository". In the Sowel core the same table drifted 42 rows short, because
# nothing failed when a spec folder was merged without its row (core issue
# #872). One line typed at pull-request time is cheaper than reconstructing a
# year of history, so this check fails the pull request rather than the release.
#
# The counterpart to this file is the phase table in the showroom's project map
# (docs/project-map.md there): this check covers THIS repository's specs, the
# map covers the seven cross-repository phases. Both are updated by the
# feature skill, at the same moment.
#
# Runs in CI and locally: `bash scripts/check-specs-index.sh`.
# Portable to bash 3.2 (macOS) — no mapfile, no associative arrays.

# ── One row per spec folder ───────────────────────────────────────────
# Pure shell. The core's copy of this script called `basename` and a `grep` per
# spec folder, which is two processes each and took ~13 s at 175 folders — long
# enough to blow the timeout of the test that ran it, so `npm run validate` and
# the pre-push hook were red for a reason unrelated to the change being pushed
# (mchacher/sowel#917). The work is a set membership test; it does not need a
# process per element. Fixed here before this repository grows enough specs to
# feel it.
# `|| true`: grep exits 1 on an index with no rows at all, and pipefail would
# then kill the script mid-check without printing anything.
